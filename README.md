#GOHARE - Flight data tracking

Go'Hare is a collection of flight tracking tools.
The name is derived from the main implementation language Go and the Chicago Oâ€™Hare International Airport.

As a long term goal, this should become a comprehensive tool supporting a large variety of data sources, like

* ADSB
* ASTERIX
* OPENSKY
* FLIGHTRADAR 24

and possibilities to view the current state, like a map or tables.

The idea is, to be able to run different connectors as separate services, being able to write tracking data to a separate storage instance. 
Different Tools or Viewers (e.g. some webapp, or Xplane, or MSFS 2020) could connect to display current data.

At this stage, this project is purely a hobby, one of the famous side projects of a professional Software Engineer :).
It is roughly based on my professional experience in this field and was supposed to be used for learning various concepts of Go.
